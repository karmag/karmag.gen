   "## Generator concept"

   (paragraph "Generators from this library are purely
   functional. This means that they can be treated in the same manner
   as regular clojure data structures and that they will produce
   repeatable results.")

   (paragraph "The primary functions for manipulating a generator are
   `step`, `elem` and `exhausted?` corresponding to *next*, *peek* and
   *has-next* functionality of iterators/generators in
   general. Generators also support a `reset` function that returns
   the \"original\" generator.")

   "## Provided generators"

   (paragraph "This is a brief overview of the generators provided
   through the `karmag.gen.core` namespace. For further information
   see the corresponding function documentation. These will clash with
   definitions in `clojure.core` so they should be required with
   an alias.")
